## Ideas

- Add Angel, fat guy with just trunks and very small wings

- Submissions are how you capture
- Start training then indies then big show then world
- Major and min injuries, minor loose turn, major lose match
- Manager specials like brassnucks and distract ref
- Low blows
- Heel and face class that your decisions dictate and will have de-buffs and buffs
- Player isn't a manger he is trying to own a territory
